# Google Meet Bot

An advance level google meet bot which will attend classes on desktop just by sending a link via phone through its web app. It will leave the classes when students are less than 30-40 in a lecture. Also it will simultaneously record the classes and prevent us from leaving the classes by reconnecting till the class end.

For an alternative solution to deploy meeting bots with transcription at scale, check out the [Meeting BaaS](https://meetingbaas.com) API.
